[Title - Fixated]

[This is a song that I wrote on my 'time of the month' days.]

[Verse 1 - Male and Female Duet]
Petrified, by my mind's reflections. 
Horrified, by my spirit's ruminations. 
Bewitched, by my psyche's obsessions. 
Locked, in my head with no refuge.

[Verse 2 - Female Voice]
How can I live? 
When eventual is unpredictable? 
When bygone is unforgettable? 
When present is depletable?

[Verse 3 - Rap]
The sky is painted with (really) vivid darkness. 
The sounds are aery with (many) insipid harshness. 
I cannot rest while my consciousness  (oh-oh)
vies to dim the dimmest of blackness.

[Pre-Chorus - Adlib]
How am I to become? 
When my own will not fight to outlive my nightmares, 
to attain my ambitions?

[Synth Solo]

[Chorus - Repeat Twice]
Fixated, I am, 
in the likeness of a glacier moved only by the ocean's currents
melting away day by day
destined to no longer exist. (I won't)

[Bridge - Fading Male Voice]
The past is gone by, when will I forget? 
Only when my anima no longer is!
