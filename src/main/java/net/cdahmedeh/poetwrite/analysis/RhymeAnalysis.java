/**
 * A result of the computation for analyzing the rhyme of two words.
 *
 * This is computed in RhymeComputer. See class comments for how the analysis is
 * actually done.
 *
 * Right now, the focus is just on basic rhyming with just counting how many
 * syllables are rhymed with in the provided word pair.
 *
 * The convention of the *Analysis files is uncomputed parts are 'null' and get
 * filled if after the computation.
 *
 * TODO: Consider using a pair object for word pairs.
 * TODO: Find a way to make word pairs reversed to be equal.
 * TODO: Partial Rhymes, Slant Rhymes
 * TODO: Have the specific phonemes that rhyme.
 * TODO: Have the syllables in text that rhyme.
