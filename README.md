# Welcome to PoetWrite!

PoetWrite is an in-progress desktop application to bring an IDE-like experience for English poetry writers. 

At the heart of PoetWrite, is an advanced rhetorical and lexical analysis engine. Whether it's detecting rhyming patterns, measuring meters or calculating sentiment. While poets are known for posessing huge vocabularies, sometimes, you still need some help to find the right word for the next stanza. So PoetWrite will come with various lexicographic dictionaries that can find synonyms matching your pattern, word relationships, various conjugations and more.

I know artificial intelligence is the hot new trend, but, all the power of PoetWrite will be AI-free. That means that all the analyses and assistance are blistering fast and completely offline. The majority of the algorithms are written from scratch with the help of some publicly available dictionaries and databases.

## Status
PoetWrite is still in an early stage of development with the beginnings of elementary analysis features. If you want to see what PoetWrite is already capable of, start with the included [unit tests](/src/test/java/net/cdahmedeh/poetwrite/test/).

## Documentation

[Poem Syntax and Domain Structure](/docs/poem-syntax-and-domain-structure.md) - PoetWrite's domain objects structure. And the poem syntax with annotation and commenting features.

[Rhetorical Analysis Basics](/docs/rhetoric-analysis-basics.md) - Introductory topics for basic rhetorical analysis features such as syllable counting and rhyme detection.

[User Experience](/docs/ux-wireframes.md) - UX Wireframes or Prototypes to show various planned features for poet-write.

## Development

PoetWrite is an open-source project under the [GPLv3 license](/LICENSE.md) with no pecuniary interests.

The design is UX first, meaning that the user-experience dictates the design and architecture of the application rather than the other way around. Throughout the development, you'll see [wireframes](/wireframes/) being added into the repository. 

As a technical writer, I believe that good documentation is part of the development process. Feel free to explore the ever-growing collection in the [documentation](/docs/) folder.

## Wireframe Prototype
This is how the PoetWrite idea was born. You can see more [here](/docs/ux-wireframes.md).
