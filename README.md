# Welcome to PoetWrite

PoetWrite is an in-progress application to augment and empower writers while writing poetry. At the centre of it all, is an advanced rhetorical and lexical analysis engine. Which will be provided as metadata to the user in the editor. Integrated is also dictionary lookups. To tie it all up, sentiment analysis and meter detection will really complete the PeotWrite experience.

I know artificial intelligence is the new hot trend. But I'm actually trying to make PoetWrite AI-free to provide blistering performance and consistency during the analysis. Even heuristic features will be based on predictable rules. And if needed be, a touch of pre-trained machine and deep learning SDKs.

## Status
PoetWrite is still in an incredibly early stage of development. The main focus right now is on a library for detecting rhymes and counting syllables. Which will be the very base features.

## Showcase and Planned Features.
- AI-free and completely offline advanced rhetorical analysis and lexical suggestion engine. Written completely from scratch with focus on accuracy and performance.
- Assistive writing with full and partial rhymes handling, dictionary suggestions, meter and pattern detection, various grammatical and stylistic devices tools.
- IDE-inspired syntax highlighting and inline visuals based on powerful parser generators.
- Designed using software engineering principles, this isn't just focused on coding. Includes automated testing, strong architectural designed, intelligent use of external libraries, distribution via installers and auto-updaters with support for major operating systems.
- Extensive documentation for the rhetorical and lexical tools, along with their inner-workings.
- Designed as a desktop application using battle-tested frameworks. Lightweight and efficient despite being written in Java. No use of bloated web-based frameworks.
- UX-first application design where user experiences comes before technical decisions.
- Plain-text based file format with support for history and metadata. Interoperable with basic text editors.
- No trade-secrets approach with code being available under a GPLv3 license. No pecuniary interests.
